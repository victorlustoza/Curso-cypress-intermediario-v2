- How to test APIs that require an access _token_
- How to create optimized, straight-to-the-point tests
- How to save the user session in the browser for later restoration
- How to validate if the user session is still valid and how to deal with it when it is invalidated
- How to clean and create the data mass before testing begins
- How to protect sensitive data such as passwords and access tokens
- How to organize tests and custom commands into different "layers" (_API, CLI, GUI_)
- How to structure tests thinking about preconditions, actions and expected results
